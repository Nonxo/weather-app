# Weather App

Since we are programmers and sit inside the whole day we would like to have an app to check the weather outside so we do not
actually have to go outside to see what it's like.

### Overview ###

This repository contains all files and dependencies needed to contribute to the existing codebase and run the project on specific browsers such e.g Google Chrome and Firefox. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The WeatherApp contains two screens:
* Loading screen
* Weather info screen

## Technology Stack
